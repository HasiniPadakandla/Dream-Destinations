                Dubai is an ideal holiday destination for families, with theme parks,
                beaches, Friday brunches and more to keep everyone happy. The famous
                Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, is well worth the
                entrance fee. Burj Al-Arab, often touted as the world's only 7-star
                hotel, remains underwhelming. Similarly, the Aquaventure Water Park at
                the Palms Atlantis Hotel is not to be missed. Jumeriah Beach Residence
                is well established as Dubai's most popular beachfront, and its close
                proximity to a whole host of restaurants, cafes and shops make it more
                than worthy of its status.
